/3dmodels

Contains directories for absorption module hook-ups into CAM
Each directory contains copies of files located in 

source/src.main
source/src.*

These files are generally should be identical, however we use duplicate copies instead
of symbolic links, so that some minor one-off changes can be incorporated into
1D or 3D distributions without corrupting the entirety of ExoRT. This
faciliates the most convenient method for sharing a common source for the
radiative transfer builds in 1D and in 3D.


To implement with ExoCAM
xmlchange CAM_CONFIG_OPTS="-usr_src /$MYDIR/ExoRT/3dmodels/src.cam.******"
One can either point -usr_src directly to the directories in /3dmodels/src.*
as is, or one can copy their /3dmodels/src.* directory somewhere else so that
they can make modificiations.  


===== radiative transfer versions for 3D model hook up =====
src.cam.n68equiv        !! September 2020, preferred version to use!!
src.cam.n42h2o  
src.cam.n68h2o
src.cam.n28archean  
src.cam.n28archean.haze  !! Special modifcation to include hazes from
			 CESM-CARMA; also requires ExoCAM "carma" additional
			 files.  Note that exo_radiation_cam_intr.F90 is
			 unqiue to this directory, containing native CAM-CARMA
			 hook-ups.
