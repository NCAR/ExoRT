3dmodels
Contains directories for absorption module hook-ups into CAM
Each directory contains copies of files located in 

source/src.main
source/src.*

These files should be identical, however we use duplicate copies instead
of symbolic links, so that some minor one-off changes can be incorporated into
1D or 3D distributions without corrupting all.

This faciliates the most convenient method for sharing a common 
source for the radiative transfer builds in 1D and in 3D.

To implement in CAM
xmlchange CAM_CONFIG_OPTS="-usr_src /$MYDIR/ExoRT/3dmodels/src.cam.******"
