3dmodels
Contains directories for absorption module hook-ups into CAM
Each directory contains symbolic links to files located in 

source/src.main
source/src.*

This faciliates the most convenient method for sharing a common 
source for the radiative transfer builds in 1D and in 3D.

To implement in CAM
xmlchange CAM_CONFIG_OPTS="-usr /$MYDIR/ExoRT/3dmodels/src.cam.******"
