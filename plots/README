Validation plots of ExoRT performance. 

1) n68equiv_H2O_tests.pdf
Decription: RT version n68equiv.  Outgoing longwave and surface shortwave
downwelling fluxes for moist greenhouse atmospheres with surface temperatures
between 250 and 360 K, H2O saturated.  Comparisons made to LBLRTM and SMART.
Note, major improvedment over from Yang et al. 2016,
doi:10.3847/0004-637X/826/2/222 which shows too strong near-IR absorption in
the SW downwelling plots for the n28archean rt scheme.

2) n68equiv_2barCO2_test.pdf 
Description: RT version n68equiv.  Outgoing longwave radiation for a 2 bar
pure CO2 atmosphere, 250 K surface temperature, 167 K startosphere.

3) n28archean_CO2_CH4_tests.pdf     
Description:  RT version n28archean.  Figure from Wolf et al. 2013, DOI:10.1089/ast.2012.0936
Longwave radiative fluxes from line-by-line calculations (LBLRTM, dashed blue)
and from our model (Archean radiative transfer, red) assuming the US 1976
Standard Atmosphere but with oxygen and ozone removed. Panels (a) and (b) show
the surface downwelling longwave flux and error compared with line-by-line
calculations for varying CO2 and CH4, respectively. Panels (c) and (d) show
the net longwave flux at the tropopause and error compared with line-by-line
calculations for varying CO2 and CH4.
