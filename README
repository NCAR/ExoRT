==== INSTRUCTIONS  ====

-- Building model

% cd ../ExoRT/build
% make all        
or
% make modelname1 modelname2 ...
example
% make n42h2o

executable is copied to ../ExoRT/run


-- input file

RTprofile_in.nc to be placed in ../ExoRT/run directory
template inputs located in  ../ExoRT/iofiles
change inputs as desired, see code idl_progs

change number of vertical levels, solar spectrum, etc in 
../ExoRT/source/src.main/exoplanet_mod.F90
	-- this code structure is left-over from extraction from ExoCAM


-- run model
% modelname.exe
example
% n42h2o.exe

This produces an output file "RTprofile_out.nc"
     


============ MORE INFO ================
Versions: "oxygen" and "highco2"

The radiation code currently has two separate configurations: "oxygen" and "highco2"
The oxygen file set has been tested to accurately reproduce current atmospheric conditions.  
The highco2 file set is for an anoxic atmosphere with high co2, high ch4.  This is the version used in Wolf & Toon (2013)  

Correlated K coefficient files were created via the method of Mlawer et al. (1997) using LBLRTM.  Gaseous overlap is treated using the amount weighted scheme of Shi et al. (2009).   H2O and CO2 continuum coefficients are derived from the MT_CKD continuum model which is part of LBLRTM.  See Halevy et al. (2009) for a good discussion of issues and uncertainties with continuum calculations.
